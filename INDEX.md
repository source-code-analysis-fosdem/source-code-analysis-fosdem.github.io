# FOSDEM 2018 Source Code Analysis devroom - Call for Participation

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is a free event for software developers
to meet, share ideas and collaborate.
Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software
from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels.
Next year it will be on [February 3-4](https://fosdem.org/2018/practical/transportation/).

Next FOSDEM will have a half day Source Code Analysis devroom for the first time.
We think it's a great opportunity to gather developers for different
projects to know each other, share ideas and build a community.

The devroom is now accepting submissions of talk proposals. We are
looking for technical (all levels, from introductory to advanced),
developer-oriented talks.
The format will be 20 minutes talk, 5-10 minutes for Q&A (30 minutes
slot per talk).

The topic of the talks should be around what static analysis can do in
the FOSS world, how itâ€™s done (tools), and how these tools and results
can be combined.

These analysis/tools include, but are not limited to:
- Parser Generation
- Linting
- Static Code Analysis
- Autocompletion
- Code transformation
- IDEs
- Refactoring

In general: all things on top of an Abstract Syntax Tree or previous
compiler analysis phases.

Please use the [Pentabarf](https://fosdem.org/submit) system to submit your proposals and file
it under the track "Source Code Analysis".
You do not need to create a new account if you already have one. When
in doubt, please use the [devroom mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/source-code-analysis-devroom).
The deadline for your proposal is on December the 1st.

Make sure to include the following in your proposal:
- Title of your talk (will be printed in the FOSDEM booklet)
- Your full name (will be printed in the FOSDEM booklet)
- A short abstract (one or two paragraphs)

The official devroom schedule (along with the accepted talks) will be
announced on December the 11th on the devroom mailing list and the
speakers will be notified via e-mail.
The schedule will also be published on the FOSDEM website.
